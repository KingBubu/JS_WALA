This repository contains WALA analyses that are implemented in JavaScript.  The [JavaScript front-end](http://wala.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Getting_Started:JavaScript_frontend) for the core WALA analysis framework (implemented in Java) is available in the [WALA repository](https://github.com/wala/WALA).  For now, this repository only contains a normalizer to ease other JavaScript analyses, but we hope to add other static and dynamic analyses in the future.  All code is available under the [Eclipse Public License](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html).
