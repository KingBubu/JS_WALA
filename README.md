This repository contains WALA analyses and tools that are implemented in JavaScript.  (This is not to be confused with the [JavaScript front-end](http://wala.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Getting_Started:JavaScript_frontend) for the core WALA analysis framework, which is implemented in Java and is available in the [WALA repository](https://github.com/wala/WALA).)

For now, this repository only contains one tool: a normalizer that converts JavaScript programs into a simpler form to ease other analyses; see directory `normalizer`.

We hope to add other analysis and instrumentation infrastructure in the future.
